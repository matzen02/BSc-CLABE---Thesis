# The Macroeconomic Impact of Carbon Tax in Europe

This repository contains the materials and code for my Bachelor's Thesis titled **"The Macroeconomic Impact of Carbon Tax in Europe"**, completed as part of my BSc in Business and Economics at the University of Bologna.

## Objective
The goal of this thesis is to replicate and update the study by Metcalf and Stock (2020), *The Macroeconomic Impact of Europe’s Carbon Tax*, using the most recent available data.  
The main contribution lies in assessing how the impact of carbon taxation has evolved in the post‑COVID‑19 context.

## Methods
The analysis employs a **panel data econometric framework**, including fixed effects and dynamic models, to estimate the effects of carbon taxation on GDP and related macroeconomic indicators.  
Several robustness checks were performed using different model specifications.

## Repository structure
- **/do_files/** — code used to clean, merge, and prepare the datasets.  
- **/figures/** — visual results (time series, impulse responses, confidence intervals).  
- **/thesis/** — full PDF of the Bachelor’s Thesis.  

## Reference
Metcalf, G., & Stock, J. H. (2020). *The Macroeconomic Impact of Europe’s Carbon Taxes*.

## Notes
This repository builds upon the original code by Metcalf and Stock, adapted to newer data and refined for educational purposes.

## After the Thesis
After the Bachelor's thesis, I decided to ask the same question for the project of the course Data Science for Economics during my Master's degree. For this project, I asked myself the same question but used completely different tools. I developed a model in Python using neural networks and Bayesian statistics.
### Results
As a first insight we see that this model give the same result as the one developed by Metcalf and Stock (2020), but it also allows us for some counterfactuals. Have a look at the assignment to discover them!
