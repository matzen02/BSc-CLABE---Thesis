# The Macroeconomic Impact of Carbon Tax in Europe

This repository contains the materials and code for my Bachelor's Thesis titled **"The Macroeconomic Impact of Carbon Tax in Europe"**, completed as part of my BSc in Business and Economics at the University of Bologna.

## Objective
The goal of this thesis is to replicate and update the study by Metcalf and Stock (2020), *The Macroeconomic Impact of Europe’s Carbon Tax*, using the most recent available data.  
The main contribution lies in assessing how the impact of carbon taxation has evolved in the post‑COVID‑19 context.

## Methods
The analysis employs a **panel data econometric framework**, including fixed effects and dynamic models, to estimate the effects of carbon taxation on GDP and related macroeconomic indicators.  
Several robustness checks were performed using different model specifications.

## Repository structure
- **/do_files/** — code used to clean, merge, and prepare the datasets.  
- **/figures/** — visual results (time series, impulse responses, confidence intervals).  
- **/thesis/** — full PDF of the Bachelor’s Thesis.
